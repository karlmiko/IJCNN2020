This repository contains samples of audio files used in:

# CODE

Follow the notebooks, from 0 to 6. The dataset (GTZan) is not included in the repository so you must download it from http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html.

To listen to the reconstructed audio, open the listen notebook.

The load_test notebook is for testing the performances of the CNNs.

If any questions arise do not hesitate in contacting me at karl.koerich@mail.mcgill.ca.
